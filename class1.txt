CLASS #1

files: syllabus.pdf, Lecture 1A.pdf, Lecture 1B.pdf, Lecture 1C.pdf

1. Course overview
- all materials will be posted up on NYU Home, under the Resources folder
- there will be folders for each lecture, etc
- structure: one 30min lunch btw 12-1, two additional 15min breaks
- homeworks:
    => optional but highly recommended
    => will be solved in the next class
- there will be a final project (80%)
- class participation is part of the final grade (10%)
- attendance as well (10%)


2. Programming
- program = code + data
- iOS is done in Objective-C (invented in 1983) or in Swift (invented in 2014)
- Objective-C & Swift have the same runtime performance
- you can mix these 2 languages inside an app
- Apple recommends to write new stuff in Swift
- likely 2-3 years down the road they will stop releasing new things in Objective-C, only in Swift


3. Xcode
- Products/NAME.app is the executable binary:
    => you can see the full path of it on the right properties panel
- Circles icon: see both header & content at the same time
    => opens the Assistant Editor
    => View => Assistant Editor: you can configure whether to put it to the right or the bottom
- icons:
    => folder: layout of files
    => structure: layout of classes
    => then: search, errors, debugger icons


4. Swift
- no semi-colons syntax
- keyword 'func' indicates that it's a function:
    func adder(first: Int, second: Int) {
        var result = first + second
        print(String(result))
    }

    adder(4, second: 5)
    => first argument:       NO LABEL
    => additional arguments: NEED LABELS
    => if you want a label for the first argument:
            func adder2(FN first: Int, second: Int) { ... }
            adder2(FN: 5, second: 9)
